TraderBot is a Python based algorithmic trading application. It looks to trade opportunities for 24/7, makes trades while you're working or sleeping. It trades on Binance, both spot and futures markets. It runs on Raspberry Pi 4 as a local server. 

When an order is placed, it sends push notification and tweet to inform user. You can follow our Twitter account (https://twitter.com/traderbotstatus)

If an exception occur while application is running, it sends an e-mail includes exception details to admins. (Currently only to me. üôÉ)
